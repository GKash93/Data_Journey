    "Machine Learning is a field within the broader study concept of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning used previously collected data and predict what the same will be in future. This has leads to new field like Computer vision, Natural Language processing, Deep Learning which along with computer vision is being used to automated driving, and so on.\n",
