    "* Python is an higher level language which means it supports Object Orient Programmings(OOPs) concept.\n",
    "* Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "* One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "* An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. attributes\n",
    "    2. behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's take an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "        * singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "* The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. class : A class is a blueprint for the object.\n",
    "    2. object: (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is                defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.\n",
    "    3. methods: Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an                  object.\n",
    "    4. Inheritance: Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying              it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class              (or parent class).\n",
    "    5. Encapsulation: Using OOP in Python, we can restrict access to methods and variables. This prevents data from direct            modification which is called encapsulation. In Python, we denote private attributes using underscore as the                prefix i.e single _ or double __ .\n",
    "    6. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types)."
